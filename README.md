This repository has the code and related material that I am using in my PyPSA project related to a 100% renewable, reliable energy system for Oahu

The following is a description of the contents of each folder:  
Data Processing: Code that performed the necessary functions to turn weather data into capacity factors  
Input Data: The energy demand or weather capacity files used as inputs for PyPSA  
Output Data: The output files for each analysis  
Plotting Code: The code used to make each graph  
HPCC: Code, information, and inputs needed to run PyPSA on Caltech's high performance computing cluster
